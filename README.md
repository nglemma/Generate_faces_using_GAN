# Generate_faces_using_GAN
I defined a GAN and trained it till it can generate realistic faces.

In this project, i'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible! 

I will be using the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) to train your adversarial networks. http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
